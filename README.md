# botornot
Data collection pipeline for curating the reverse Turing test bot detection dataset.

## Preliminary Ideas:
- Live flask based application for chat backend.
- MySQL persistence layer for data storage.
- Simple interface: https://codepen.io/ktchntn/pen/ygQBem
- Devise some easy method to inject bot api.
- Consider UX/UI implications for chat systems:
  - Adding live typing interfaces
  - For bots, have some default method to delay the message throughput based on some distribution

## TODO:
- Read original Turing literature.
- Find other literature and similar experiment methodology setups.
